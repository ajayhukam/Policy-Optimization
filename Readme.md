# Policy Optimization for Financial Decision-Making

## Overview
This project explores *loan approval optimization* using both *Supervised Deep Learning* and *Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL)* approaches.  
The goal is to improve decision-making for a fintech companyâ€™s loan approval process using historical LendingClub data (2007â€“2018).  

The project demonstrates how predictive modeling and policy learning can be combined to balance *risk management* and *profit maximization*.

---

## Objectives
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on LendingClub loan data.  
2. Train a *Deep Learning (MLP)* model to predict loan default risk.  
3. Frame the same problem as an *Offline Reinforcement Learning* task using *CQL (Conservative Q-Learning)*.  
4. Compare and analyze both modelsâ€™ decision-making behaviors and financial implications.  
5. Document insights and recommendations for future deployment.

ðŸš€ Running the Project
ðŸ§  1. Supervised Learning Model (MLP)
Train and evaluate the Deep Learning model:
python train_supervised_mlp.py

Outputs:

Test metrics: AUC = 0.711, F1 = 0.157


ðŸ¤– 2. Offline Reinforcement Learning (CQL)
Train the offline RL agent:
python train_rl_cql.py

Outputs:


Trained model saved as models/cql_model/


Evaluation metric: Estimated Policy Value (EPV) printed after training
